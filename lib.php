/* THEME_STAGETWO BUILDING NOTES
 * =============================
 * Lib functions have been split into separate files, which are called
 * from this central file. This is to aid ongoing development as I find
 * it easier to work with multiple smaller function-specific files than
 * with a single monolithic lib file. This may be a personal preference
 * and it would be quite feasible to bring all lib functions back into
 * a single central file if another developer prefered to work in that way.
